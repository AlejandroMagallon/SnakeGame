# SnakeGame
This is a fully featured recreation of the classic Snake game I built in Python using the Pygame library. Designed with modular object oriented programming principles. This project demonstrates my understanding of graphics rendering, user input handling, collision detection, and game loop control

Features
Smooth Snake Movement using vector math.
Real-Time Input Handling with support for both WASD and arrow keys.
Apple/Fruit Spawning with collision checking.
Score Tracking and dynamic score display.
Custom Graphics for snake head, body, and tail in all directions.
Curved Snake Body rendering for realistic turns.
Custom Sound Effects for gameplay feedback.
Grid-Based Background for a polished look.
Game Over Detection when hitting walls or the snakeâ€™s own body.
Automatic Reset on collision for replayability.

Technologies Used
Python 3
Pygame (graphics and sound)
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
Assets
Graphics and sounds used in this game are organized in:
Graphics/ (for all image assets)
Sound/ (for sound effects)
Font/ (custom font for score display)

What I Learned
Implementing game loops and event handling in real time.
Using classes and objects to manage complex game components.
Handling sprite-based animation and direction-aware rendering.
Managing screen updates and frame rate using timers and clocks.
Incorporating custom sounds and graphics into Python games.
